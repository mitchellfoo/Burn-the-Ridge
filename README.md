# Burn-the-Ridge

Independant game being developed and designed by Mitchell Foo.

Original game started as coursework at Carnegie Mellon University for the class Understanding Game Engines taught by Thomas Corbett.

Game is inspired by old space shooter like Rogue Squadron and Starfox, and now more recently, Star Wars Squadrons.
The game is a trench runner roguelite (-like?) where you fly in cockpit view down a Death Star inspired trench surviving through waves of enemies.
Each completed round rewards the player with a selection of stacking upgrades to their ship.

Game is still in its very early stages of development.
